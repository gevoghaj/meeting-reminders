# Meeting Reminders

This project is still under active changes, the following description of use may change in the near future.

## Usage

This page is designed to be used in a landscape setting, vertical aspect ratios will not work correctly.

### Parameters

`h` hour: (defaults to an hour later than your device) What hour the meeting starts.

`m` minute: (defaults to 0) What minute the meeting starts.

`s` second: (optional, defaults to 0) The second the meeting starts. Honestly not sure why this would be needed, but hey
here it is if needed.

`mgap` minute gap: (optional, defaults to 60) Helps create the pie chart timer. Without it there is nothing to start the rotation
against.

`smgab` short minute gap: (optional, defaults to 1) Minutes before start time when the last minute information should be shown.
Recommended not to change, 1 minute is preferred by the branch.
